Welcome! Litho's Armory is a relatively small mod focused entirely on adding new equipment to Terraria.
Currently, the only items added are weapons/ammo and crafting ingredients.

There's not really much to say here, since this GitHub is mostly intended for integration with the Browser.
The mod is set to include source code, meaning you can decompile it ingame and look at the code.

Select my mod in your mods list and click "More Info", then "Extract". This should give you the source.
